# Unexpected Null Return in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving null checks and function behavior.  The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but it unexpectedly returns `null` if either input is `null`.  This behavior is demonstrated in the `bug.js` file.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by implementing stricter null checks and improved error handling to ensure robust behavior with various input types.  The README provides a clear explanation of the problem and how the solution improves it.
